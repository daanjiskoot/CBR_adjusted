    "## What is a protein?\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are tiny molecular machines inside our cells. They are made of long chains of **amino acids** that fold into specific 3D shapes. The shape of a protein determines what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is drug design?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many diseases are caused by proteins that don't work properly, or work *too much*. A **drug** is a small molecule that fits into a protein like a key fits into a lock. When the drug binds to the protein, it can turn the protein on or off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The place where the drug binds is called the **binding site** (or binding pocket).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our target: Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will study the **Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα)**. This protein plays a key role in breast cancer. Many breast cancers grow because ERα is over-active. Drugs like **tamoxifen** block ERα and are used to treat breast cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at a crystal structure called **3ERT**, which shows ERα bound to **4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT)** — the active form of tamoxifen.\n",
